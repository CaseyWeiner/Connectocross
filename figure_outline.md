Similar to README but by Figure

# Figure X: graspy figure, showing all of the different models, for each connectome
- a priori model selection  
- will have to try lots of different ways of defining the blocks 

# Figure X: spectral clustering hierarchies on every connectome 
- a posteriori model selection one

# Figure X: how symmetric are the brains, bilateral symmetry
- how symmetric are edges as a function of the edge weights
    - edge weight distributions by L/R type
- edge weight distributions by L->L, L->R etc. 
- nonpar/semipar? 
- GM for quantifying

# Figure X: Gaia's directedness
- in degree vs out degree
- something about testing for whether pij = pji
- or how correlated are pij and pji
- can also do something at the block level!

# Figure X: how feedforward are the brains 

# Figure X: how homophillic/assortative are they 

# Figure X: how homotopic is it 

# Figure X: here's a model with all of the stuff we just said exists
