Similar to README but by Figure

# Figure X: graspy figure, showing all of the different models, for each connectome
- a priori model selection  
- will have to try lots of different ways of defining the blocks 

# Figure X: spectral clustering hierarchies on every connectome 
- a posteriori model selection one

# Figure X: how symmetric are the brains

# Figure X: how feedforward are the brains 

# Figure X: how homophillic are they 

# Figure X: how homotopic is it 

# Figure X: distribution of edge weights for each graph plot
- how symmetric are edges as a function of the edge weights

# Figure X: are the graphs meaningfully directed?
- testing for strength of directedness

# Figure x: in degree, out degree
