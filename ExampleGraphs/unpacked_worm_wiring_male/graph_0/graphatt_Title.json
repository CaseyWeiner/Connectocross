"Connectome Adjacency Matrices  These sheets give the whole-animal connectomes for the two adult sexes of C. elegans.  They provide the amount of connectivity between each pair of cells.  For chemical connections, rows give the pre-synaptic cell, columns give the post-synaptic cell.  Weights in the body of the matrices are the total number of EM serial sections of connectivity, taking into account both the number of synapses and the sizes of synapses.  To provide complete coverage of the entire nervous system, the data are assembled from multiple animals and include connections added by extrapolation in gaps where no data were available.  The data in these tables is used in the figures of Cook et al.  July, 2019\nCorrections, July 2020  The attempt is made here to remove all inconsistencies and errors in the published tables.  In particular, for the gap junction tables, values across the diagonal should match and be consistent with the values in the asymmetric tables."
